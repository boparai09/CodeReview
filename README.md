## Inital review comments
Authors Component's selector was wrong and it was not included in NgModule  declarations. So app was failing.

## To run

Run `npm install` and `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Use `ng serve --port 4021` to change port to `4201` if  needed
